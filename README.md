opencourses
===========

Because college doesn't have to be difficult.


TODO -  this entire project 
        clean up readme

tldr; 
  opencourses (final name pending) is a repository dedicated to boiling down university courses into a single wiki page. Each page should contain enough information to ace the final exam for the class, and be presented in a neat, readable format. 
  
  The goal of the project is to bring to light some problems with our education system (at least at Texas A&M) -- courses are geared towards tests and ranking students, rather than efficient learning. These pages should ideally be the most efficient way to learn the material.
